# Iterative Mandelbrot Set Solver
The precision required to view a "good" approximation of the Mandelbrot set increases quickly as you zoom in the smaller scales. Most programs have a predefined resolution (some kind of `MAX_ITERATIONS`), which means the fractal quickly loses integrity as you zoom in. 

With this program, there has been no such compromise - you watch in real time as the program iterates and the Mandelbrot Set takes shape. The only limit to the resolution you can get is how long you want to leave the program running.

### Functionality
- Zoom: click on the upper-left (1st click) and lower-right (2nd click) corner of an imaginary rectangle that frames the area that you want to zoom in to
- Switch coloring scheme: `c` (bw/color of my choice/transparent)
- Save canvas: `Enter`
